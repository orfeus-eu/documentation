**Large-N seismology onshore and offshore, mobile instrument pools, novel & massive datasets: challenges and opportunities**

**Celebrating 100 years of instrumental seismology in Finland**


The ORFEUS Annual Observatory Meeting and Workshop was held in Helsinki on 5-7 November 2024. About 125 attendees (90 in person, 35 online) gathered to celebrate the centennial of instrumental seismology in Finland and to discuss the opportunities and challenges of Large-N mobile seismology experiments onshore and offshore. The workshop was co-organised by ORFEUS with the financial support of project Geo-INQUIRE (https://www.geo-inquire.eu/) and the local organisational support of the Institute of Seismology of the University of Helsinki (https://www.helsinki.fi/en/institute-seismology).
