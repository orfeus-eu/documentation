The ORFEUS Annual Observatory Meeting and Workshop was held in Helsinki on 5-7 November 2024. About 125 attendees (90 in person, 35 online) gathered to celebrate the centennial of instrumental seismology in Finland and to discuss the opportunities and challenges of Large-N mobile seismology experiments onshore and offshore.
