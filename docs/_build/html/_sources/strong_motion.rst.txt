Strong Motion
================================================

The Strong Motion Services within ORFEUS are grouped in two complimentary Strong Motion Data Portals:

* The Rapid Raw Strong Motion database (RRSM) - an entirely automated system that uses open data from EIDA. It provides earthquake information and strong motion parameters including PGA and PGV within minutes of any event.

* The Engineering Strong-Motion database (ESM) - a reviewed archive of accelerometric waveforms from events with magnitudes above 4.0 recorded in Europe and the middle-East since 1969. It provides unprocessed acceleration time-series, manually processed acceleration, velocity, and displacement waveforms, acceleration and displacement response spectra, and other relevant engineering parameters.
