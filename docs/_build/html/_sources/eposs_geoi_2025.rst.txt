**From Big and Novel Datasets to AI for Frontier Seismological Science and Services**

The EPOS Seismology (ORFEUS+EFEHR+EMSC) workshop was held in Athens on 24-27 November 2025. About 180 attendees (120 in person, 59 online) gathered for updates on the most recent advances in seismological data services and research, with emphasis on crowdsourced data, DAS, machine learning, marine and environmental seismology, seismic hazard and risk applications. The workshop was financially supported by project Geo-INQUIRE (https://www.geo-inquire.eu/) and by EPOS ERIC (MYCA WP25), and locally organised by staff members of the National Observatory of Athens (https://www.noa.gr/en/).
